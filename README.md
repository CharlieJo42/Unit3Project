Meditation tracker app (clever name still pending)

A user can log in and track how long they meditated for that day (with option to delete entries)

Reach goals: 
Implement some sort of timer interface //
Implement "goals" and compare against actual data (i.e. User wants to meditate for 10 min and then submits "10 min")

User stories:
Welcome page for all users //
Login or Register option (depending on whether or not person is a first-time guest) //
Main page has an input field for the user to submit how long they meditated  //
History is saved so progress can be seen over time //
User has option to delete an entry //
